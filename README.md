# CONFIGURATION FOR TEEWORLD SERVER

https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=server_setup

## Linux

Open up a terminal and use the command cd to enter the teeworlds directory.

To start the server, type

    teeworlds_srv -f serverconfig.cfg

where you replace serverconfig.cfg with the name of your config file.

## Remote console

To be able to execute server commands while playing, there is a remote console. To open it, press F2 (or the key you have chosen). You will now be asked to enter a password. If you did not set up a password in your config, a random one will have been generated: check the server log.

To find out what commands that are available on the server, read the Server Commands doc.
